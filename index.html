    <h3><u>Three Quotations</u></h3>

    <p><i>"Conceal me what I am, and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent"</i></p>
    
    <p>In this quote, Viola is asking the captain for his aid in disguising her as a man to help make Illyrian life easier. 
       It will also help her in obtaining a job working for duke Orsino. This is related to appearance and reality because 
       to other characters in the play, she appears as a man, but the reader sees her as a woman and knows the circumstances 
       as to why she is doing so. Due to her disguise, it causes problems later in the play when Sebastian is mistaken as her.</p>

    <p><i>"Aside yet, a barful strife! Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife."</i></p>
    
    <p>In this scene, Orsino asks Viola to abandon manners, to go woo Olivia for him and to come back with results. However, Viola 
       and Orsino have known each other for only three days and they have gotten to know each other very well in that time. Due to 
       the time that they have spent together, Viola has fallen in love with Orsino, but she cannot confess her love to him as that 
       would expose her identity as a woman. So instead, Viola reluctantly goes to try and woo Olivia for Orsino.</p>

    <p><i>"Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause, but I bespake you fair, and hurt you not." (5.1.180-182)</i></p>
    
    <p>Near the end of the play, Sir Andrew attempts to challenge Cesario to a duel to prove his love to Olivia. Viola is then 
       mistaken for her brother Sebastian, who drew his sword at Sir Andrew in confusion and in self-defense. Sir Andrew then attempts 
       to blame Viola of assulting him and in response, Viola denies the accusations. Due to Viola's disguise and fake appearance, she is 
       now experiencing the consequences of doing so.</p>
