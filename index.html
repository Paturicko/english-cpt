    <h1><u>Appearance vs. Reality</u></h1>
    <h2>Others are not always what they appear to be</h2>
    <h4>Patrick T</h4>

    <h3><u>Three Quotations</u></h3>

    <p><i>"Conceal me what I am, and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent." (1.2.53-55)</i></p>
    
    <p>In th asking the captain for his aid in disguising her as a man to help make Illyrian life easier. 
       It will also help her in obtaining a job working for duke Orsino. This is related to appearance and reality because 
       to other characters in the play, she appears as a man, but the reader sees her as a woman and knows the circumstances 
       as to why she is doing so. Due to her disguise, it causes problems later in the play when Sebastian is mistaken as her.</p>

    <p><i>"Yet, a barful strife! Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife." (1.4.41-42)</i></p>
    
    <p>In this scene, Orsino asks Viola to abandon manners, to go woo Olivia for him and to come back with results. However, Viola 
       and Orsino have known each other for only three days and they have gotten to know each other very well in that time. Due to 
       the time that they have spent together, Viola has fallen in love with Orsino, but she cannot confess her love to him as that 
       would expose her identity as a woman. So instead, Viola reluctantly goes to try and woo Olivia for Orsino.</p>

    <p><i>"Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause, but I bespake you fair, and hurt you not." (5.1.180-182)</i></p>
    
    <p>When Viola tries to go woo Olivia for Orsino, Olivia ends up falling for Viola instead. Near the end of the play, Sir Andrew attempts 
       to challenge Cesario to a duel to prove his love to Olivia. Viola is then mistaken for her brother Sebastian, who drew his sword at Sir Andrew 
       in confusion and in self-defense. Sir Andrew then attempts to blame Viola of assulting him and in response, Viola denies the accusations. 
       This is related to appearance and reality beacuse due to Viola's disguise and fake appearance, she is now experiencing the consequences of doing so.</p>

    <h3><u>Three Pieces of Art</u></h3>
    
    <center><p><i>Wolf in Sheep Clothing</i></p></center>
    <center><p><i>By: Justin Lee Williams</i></p></center>
    
    <img src ="wolf-in-sheep-clothing-justin-lee-williams.jpg" class = "center">

    <p>In this image a wolf is wearing the skin of a sheep, presumably to disguise itself into a crowd of other sheep.
       The wolf uses its appearance in order to trick sheep, when the reality is that the wolf is actually trying to hunt them.
       This art piece tells people that even though a person may look like one of your own, it is not wise to trust them immediately.
       This idiom originated from a book in the New Testament in which it says to not trust false prophets wearing sheep's clothing.</p>
    
    <center><p><i>Relativity</i></p></center>
    <center><p><i>By: Maurits Cornelis Escher</i></p></center>

    <img src = "relativity-mc-escher.jpg" class = "center">

    <p>This art piece is a more abstract perspective on appearance vs. reality. The lithograph depicts various people going up or down flights
       of stairs and more. However, the direction of gravitational pull is different for each group of people. This helps portray the theme of
       appearance and reality, you may view a set of stairs normally and then realize that there is another person using those same set of
       stairs much more differently. I think this tells us that theres more than one side to anything whether it's a person or thing.</p>

    <center><p><i>Rubin Vase</i></p></center>
    <center><p><i>By: Edgar Rubin</i></p></center>

    <img src = "rubin-vase-edgar-rubin.jpg" class = "rubin-vase-center">

    <p>This image can vary from person to person at first glance. This illusion tests whether or not you can see the vase the 
       middle or the two faces on the left and right. At first, it may be difficult to notice the faces if you noticed the vase first, or 
       it may be hard to notice the vase if you saw the two faces first. This piece has the same recurrent theme as the other art pieces,
       you may believe something to be a certiant way but there can be a whole other side that you wont notice at a first glance.</p>
    
    <h3><u>Text-to-World</u></h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal">The Watergate Scandal</a>
    <p>Before President Richard Nixon's re-election into his second term, five burglars attempted to wiretap the Democratic National Committee (DNC) 
       headquarters at Watergate on June 17, 1972. Four of the five burglars were CIA and the other was working as a security chief for Nixon, which 
       drew suspicion to him. At first Nixon would deny the accusations, but it was later revealed that Richard Nixon ordered the five burglars to wiretap 
       the DNC to get information on the Democratic Party nominee. Nixon may have appeared to be a honest president, but he was willing to lie and commit 
       crime to ensure that he got re-elected.</p>

    <h3><u>Text-to-Text</u></h3>

    <p>In the novel Holes, there is a character whose nickname is Zero who is different than what he seems to be. In the book, children who have commited 
       crimes are sent to a detention camp called Camp Green Lake, where they are supposed to dig holes that are five feet wide and deep to build character. 
       It is revealed that Zero does not know how to read or write, the main character Stanley offers to teach him in exchange for digging a portion of his 
       hole everyday. At first it may seem that Zero is very cold and distant, but opens up to Stanley over the course of the book and reveals his generous 
       and kind nature.</p>

    <h3><u>Text-to-Self</u></h3>

      <p>In various kinds of media, characters can appear to be one way, but in reality can be different from what you thought. I believe that all of us,
        including myself are like this in much more small ways. We all act differently depending on who are around us. I act much more differently with my friends
        than I would with my family or people I dont know. I also do not know how friends and close family members act around other people either because I
        have only seen one side of them. </p>

    <h3><u>Poetry Piece</u></h3>
    
    <p><i>Sonnet 130</i></p>
    <p><i>By: William Shakespeare</i></p>
    <p>My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun; </p>
    <p>Coral is far more red than her lips’ red; </p>    
    <p>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; </p>    
    <p>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. </p>    
    <p>I have seen roses damask’d, red and white, </p>    
    <p>But no such roses see I in her cheeks; </p>    
    <p>And in some perfumes is there more delight </p>    
    <p>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. </p>    
    <p>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know </p>    
    <p>That music hath a far more pleasing sound; </p>    
    <p>I grant I never saw a goddess go; </p>    
    <p>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: </p>    
    <p>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare </p>    
    <p>As any she belied with false compare. </p>    
    
    <p>In this poem, the speaker attempts to compare their love to a goddess. The speaker talks about physical appearance, the first impression that you 
       get from a person. In comparison, the speakers lover seems imperfect, but the speaker says that their love is a rare form of love. I think that
       this type of love is unconditional love. The speaker acknowledges their own lovers imperfections, however the speaker insinuates that he still
       loves her since her appearance does not represent who she really is. </p>
